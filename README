APP DESCRIPTION

168 Hours helps you track how you are spending your time on a daily or weekly basis across a set of activities.

The app is meant for anyone that has a strong motivation to track how they use their time and can be used for personal reasons, research, work (though it may not be as ideal as other apps for work), etc.

The inspiration for the app came from a lecture by Prof. Harry Kraemer at the Kellogg School of Management that covered the benefits of comparing how you are spending the 168 hours you have each week against your priorities to check for alignment. Furthermore, some articles claim that self-tracking can improve productivity, and ultimately, happiness.
